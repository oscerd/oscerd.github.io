I'm an open source enthusiast and **Senior Principal Software Engineer** at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com), working on integration technologies. I co-lead the [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org) project together with Claus Ibsen, focusing on enterprise integration.

## Current Focus

I'm currently working on expanding the Camel ecosystem through subprojects like:

- **Camel Spring Boot** - Spring Boot integration for Apache Camel
- **Camel Quarkus** - Supersonic, subatomic Java integrations
- **Kamelets** - Reusable route snippets for easy integrations

I'm also actively contributing to Syndesis, Hawtio, Fabric8, and various other open source projects.

## Interests

Beyond integration, I'm passionate about:

- Security and cryptography
- Cloud-native technologies
- Developer experience and tooling
